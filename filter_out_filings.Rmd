```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
all_data <- readRDS("./data/data_990.RDS")
```

Things to Filter: 
- Amended 990 Forms  
- Removing 990T  
- Change in fiscal year (will require research)

## Detecting Groups who Changed Fiscal Year  
Prior to choosing how we keep ones with change of fiscal year (bridge the gap, short year), we need to detect those who did change their fiscal year.   

## Filtering Amended 990s and 990T  

```{r, filtering}
## Retain only 990, 990 EZ's that are not marked as amended
filter_data <- all_data %>%
  filter(is.na(AmendedReturnInd)) %>%
  filter(ReturnTypeCd == "990" | ReturnTypeCd == "990EZ")
```
