##this is Ruth's dataset. It includes EIN, Business Name, Year, Total Employee Count, Total Volunteer count from the get_vars function. It also includes a state column, which was merged in SQL from Zhen's state file. Because my dataset deals with unpaid labor, all filings with NA values for employees and volunteers were omitted. Additionally, four variables were calculated: empminusvol is the number of employees minus the number of volunteers, EmpoverVol is the number of employees divided by the number of volunteers, emprank is the numerical ranking based on the number of repeorted employees, and volrank is the numerical ranking based on the number of reported volunteers.

1. Create a pretty visualization on a US map colored by region. Each region should have the total percent share of volunteer labor for that region. This should be calculated as the total number of volunteers FOR THAT REGION divided by the total number of employees plus volunteers FOR THAT REGION. 
```{r}
options(digits = 4)
state_percent_share<-ruthdata %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(
    sum_volunteers = sum(TotalVolunteersCnt),
    sum_employees = sum(TotalEmployeeCnt),
    company_num = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    percent_share = (sum_volunteers / (sum_employees + sum_volunteers)) * 100
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percent_share)) %>% 
  make_table()
state_percent_share
```

```{r}
# Load required packages
library("usmap")

# join volunteer percentage of each state to us map
map_data_pct<-map_with_data(ruthdata %>% select(state, volunteer_pct) %>% mutate(values = volunteer_pct))

state_coords <- map_data_pct %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(lat = mean(x), long = mean(y))

map<-ggplot(data = map_data_pct) +

                state %in% c("AL", "FL", "GA", "KY", "LA", "MS", "NC", "SC", "TN") ~ "South")) )

```

```{r}
options(digits = 4)
regions_num <- data_trend %>%

                                 end = .9)+
  theme_bw()

```

```{r}

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack")+

    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")
  )
  

```


3. Figure out trends of employees and volunteers through the pandemic and identify shifts in these variables over the pandemic

```{r}
# how rank of percent volunteer change each year for all comapnies
ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = data_trend, aes(x = year, y = rank_pct, color = as.factor(BusinessName)))+
    geom_line()+
    theme_bw()+
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,
                                 option = "rocket",
                                 end = .9)
)
```
The trend is not conspicuous.

It appears that the difference, on average, in the median of total employees between 17-19 and 20-21 decreased by 36.8 employees and the median number of employees decreased by 5.5 on average, and the maximum value decreased by 13.                      
On average, it appears that the difference in the mean of total volunteers between 17-19 and 20-21 decreased by 38.3 volunteers and the median number of volunteers decreased by 22.5 volunteers , on average, but the range remained the same. 

Finally, volrank minus emprank takes the independent rankings of each type of labor when compared with all other variables in the dataset. The higher this number is, the more the specific company relies on unpaid labor than the other dance companies in the dataset. When looking at the difference between volrank minus emprank, it appears that the difference in the mean of rank difference between 17-19 and 20-21 decreased by .4 and the median difference in rank increased by 1.5, on average, and the maximum difference in the two rankings decreased by 41. 

Findings suggest that the pandemic saw a decline in both paid (employee) labor and unpaid (volunteer) labor, but that the most drastic loss of labor occured for volunteers rather than employees.
